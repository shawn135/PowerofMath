Build an End-to-End AWS Web Application from Scratch using the AWS sercives of AWS Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and IAM


Step 1: I deployed and hosted a web page using AWS Amplify. 
Step 2: I used Lambda to run Python code 
Step 3: I used API Gateway to trigger the lambda function to run
Step 4: I used DynamoDB as a key-value Database 
Step 5: I used IAM to set permissions to the database/app

I actually did not record my progress through this project I do have the set up finished project here though.
